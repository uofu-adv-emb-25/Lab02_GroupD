1. How to setup test scenario
-Split up methods -- have blink and case-changing portions of code in their own methods with input arguments.
-Blink takes in an argument of count to determine if the LED should turn on/off.
-Have a header file where these methods can be declared and accessed via test.c to be tested.

2. How to exercise system
-For each test, have a TEST_ASSERT_TRUE_MESSAGE that indicates if it was passed and TEST_FAIL_MESSAGE if the test was failed.
-To test the case-changing code, try a couple capital letters (A,C, whatever) and see if (a,c,...) ASCII values are returned.
-To test the blink code, give counts that are a multiple of 11 (11, 22, etc) and the blink method should return true. If not multiple of 11 (15, 18, etc). blink method should return false.

3. Expected behavior
-Hopefully, all of the TEST_ASSERT_TRUE_MESSAGES should appear. I think I wrote expected behavior in the section above.
